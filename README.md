# Flappy Bird

Welcome! I created this Java Flappy Bird in High School as part of my Computer Science Individual Assessment (IA) for the International Baccalaureate (IB) program. Nothing has been done to the code since its submission about 8 years ago of this commit. It's mainly here to remind myself of the code I wrote. It's sort of a fun refactoring practice every time I look at it.
